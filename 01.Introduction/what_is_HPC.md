# What is HPC? 

High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. HPC systems are designed to perform a large number of calculations at extremely high speeds, enabling researchers and engineers to tackle problems that are too large or complex for standard computers.

## Key Features of HPC

- **Parallel Processing**: HPC systems can perform multiple calculations simultaneously by distributing tasks across many processors.
- **Scalability**: HPC systems can be scaled up by adding more processors or nodes, allowing them to handle larger datasets and more complex simulations.
- **High Throughput**: HPC systems can process vast amounts of data quickly, making them suitable for tasks such as simulations, data analysis, and modeling.
- **Specialized Hardware**: Many HPC systems use specialized hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), to accelerate specific types of computations.    

The philosophy of an HPC system is **"always available, always on"**. This means that HPC systems are designed to be operational 24/7, providing continuous access to computational resources for users.

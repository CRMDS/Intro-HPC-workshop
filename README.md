# Introduction to High Performance Computing (HPC) Workshop
**Instructors: Rosalind Wang, Kieran Luken**

This workshop is based on the [intro to HPC workshop](https://adacs-australia.github.io/KLuken_HPC_training_2022B/) run for Kieran by ADACS. Content is adapted for use on WSU CDMS's HPC wolffe. 

This workshop is designed to introduce participants to the basics of High Performance Computing (HPC) using the wolffe cluster at Western Sydney University. It has three main sections:
1. [**Introduction to HPC**](./01.Introduction/): This section covers the basics of what HPC is, how it differs from traditional computing, and why it is important for research and data analysis.
2. [**Working on Wolffe**](./02.Working_on_Wolffe/): This section provides practical guidance on how to access and use the wolffe cluster, including how to submit jobs, workflows, and parallel computing. This section includes hands-on exercises to help participants gain practical experience.
3. [**Workflow and Containers**](./03.Workflow_and_containers/): This section introduces the concept of workflows and how to use containers to manage software dependencies and ensure reproducibility in research. It covers tools like Nextflow and Singularity, which are commonly used in HPC environments.


**Pre-requisites:**
- Basic SSH knowledge (how to connect to a remote server)
- Basic git knowledge (how to clone a repository)
- Basic knowledge of the command line (Linux/Unix)
- Familiarity with programming
